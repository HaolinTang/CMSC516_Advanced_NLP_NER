## Overview
**Named-entity recognition (NER)** is a sub-task of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities in text into pre-defined categories such as the names of persons, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. In this project, we will apply three methods into NER in resumes and ten named entities will be recognized. First, we will download the resumes data with annotations and then implement the necessary data preprocessing steps. Second, the sapCy NER model, conditional random field (CRF) model and BERT model will be built for this task. Third, we will compare the performance of above three models and test them using an unseen rewume of an employee.
